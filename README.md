Project: a web-based application to help people learn driving (online and in-person) and pass DMV test
Activity diagrams were fun to start with, and I enjoyed creating/updating/improving them.
I need to improve Use Case diagram, and also learn how to put enough information there that explain all the important sections, and also avoiding a busy and unreadable diagram at the same time
With reading user's requests, clarifying any area that may seem vague, and communicating with teammates, we were able to incorporate most of the client's needs and request, however, we need to be in constant communication with the client to make sure that we are on the same page
I mainly used Lucidchart for designing diagrams, however I am interested to use Visio as well, and try some other to find the bets solution for the future projects.
